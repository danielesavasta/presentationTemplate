  ### Tinkering is what happens when you try something you don’t quite know how to do, guided by whim, imagination, and curiosity.
  ### When you tinker, there are no instructions, but there are also no failures, no right or wrong way of doing things. It’s about figuring out how things work and reworking them.
  — Massimo Banzi, one the originators of the Arduino

## use cases
A use case attempts to explain in plain language what a certain function does and why.
Uses cases also describe whom the function involves. Cases begin by identifying a set of potential actors.

- *A title* This should be descriptive, since it will be referenced often, both in documents and conversation.
- *The actors* Who is performing the function?
- *The purpose* What is this use case meant to accomplish and why?
- *The initial condition* What is happening when the use case starts?
- *The terminal condition* What will happen once the use case ends?
- *The primary steps* Discrete moments in this piece of functionality.

## use cases - example
### A use case from an e-mail project
- *A title.* “Send an E-mail.”
- *The actors* In the e-mail example, the actors are the user and the system.
- *The purpose* For the function sending an e-mail, the purpose would be something like this: “An actor wants to send a message to someone electronically.”
- *The initial condition* The e-mail client is open.
- *The terminal condition* The condition is again simple: an e-mail has been sent.
- *The primary steps*
1. Actor opens up a new mail window.
2. Actor enters the e-mail address of the recipient or selects it from the address book.
3. Actor enters a subject.
4. Actor enters message.
5. Actor sends mail via some method (for example, a button click).
6. The system checks to make sure the mail has a recipient address.
7. The system closes the mail window.
8. The system sends the mail.
9. The system puts a copy of the mail into the sent mail folder.
